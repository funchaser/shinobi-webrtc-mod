Brief manual for WebRTC modification of original build

Hello everyone! Greate news - no more delays for streams! I have manage to modify the original sources and added the WebRTC streaming possibility from this project: https://github.com/mpromonet/webrtc-streamer.

See sample on my Youtube: https://youtu.be/TAHFRzbaYe4

Left video is WebRTC vs HLS on the right.

Unfortunately, I am not very good in JS programming, so my code looks terrible (((

I am posting here all the instructions and hope that Mr. Moeiscool would implement it into the original sources, so everyone could enjoy REALTIME WebRTC streaming in Shinobi!
